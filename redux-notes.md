### Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

1. It is for JavaScript apps
2. It is a state container
3. It is predictable

### Redux is for JavaScript applications

- Redux is not tied to React.
- It can be used with any UI library or framework such as React, Angular, Vue, or even vanilla JavaScript.
- Redux is an library for JavaScript applications.

### Redux is a state container

- Redux store the state of your application.
- State of an application simply mean the state shared by all the individual components of that app.
- Redux will store and manage the application state.

### Redux is predictable

- Redux is a state container.
- The state of the application can change.
- For ex: In a todo list app - item (**pending**) --> item (**completed**).
- In redux, a pattern is enforced to ensure all state transitions are explicit and can be tracked.
- Thus, the changes to your application's state become predictable.

## Q&A

**Q. What is Redux?**

A. Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

**Q. Why Redux?**

A.
If you want to manage the global state of your application in a predictable way, redux cna help you.

The patterns and tools provided by Redux make it easier to understand when, where, why, and how the state in your application is being updated, and how your application logic will behave when those changes occur.

Redux guides you toward writing code that is predictable and testable, whcih helps give you confidence that your application will work as expected.
